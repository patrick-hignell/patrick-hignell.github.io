        <p class="center">Welcome to the beginning!</p>
        <p class="center">
          As with all good Hero’s Journey’s we begin with the tranquil setting
          of the home page. From here you will answer the call to adventure and
          face the perilous dangers of my blog entries, all accessible by
          traversing through the portal that is the side bar.

          But first we must paint the scene and tell you a little of our
          protagonist.

        <p class="center">
          My name is Patrick and I live in Tawa, near Wellington.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          I am attending De Academy as I coding has always been a passion of
          mine and something I have always enjoyed doing in my spare time. have
          dabbled in coding from an early age, initially in GameMaker and later
          in Unity (with a fair amount of VBA to make overly complicated excel
          spreadsheets!). I trained to be a doctor because I like helping people
          and I currently work in mental health. The job can be rewarding but
          stressful! I want to now try and find something that will sustain me
          in the long term and try to make a career out of something I choose to
          do as a hobby!
        </p>
        <!--  <p class="center">
          I like working in a team and like to try and see things from other
          people’s point of view. I like to think that whilst everyone has their
          own perspectives and past experiences, deep down most people want the
          best for each other.
