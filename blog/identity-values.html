        <h1>My Origin Story</h1>
        <p>
          I grew up in Cornwall, a county in England. Cornwall is the most
          southwest county on the mainland and is known for its beaches and
          moors. It is a place of great natural beauty, with features similar to
          certain parts of New Zealand, which goes to explain some of my
          affinity for New Zealand and my eventual decision to move here. I
          spent much of my time hiking and admiring nature, an interest I hold
          to this day. I grew up in the town of Bodmin, a town of ~15,000 people
          situated on Bodmin moor in the centre of north Cornwall. Bodmin is a
          relatively poor town in Cornwall, although I grew up comparatively
          well off in a middle-class family, my father was a GP and my mother
          was a chiropodist. The town has few primary schools and only one
          secondary school and so I grew up with friends who were from less well
          off backgrounds and I could see the impact of this on their
          opportunities that they were able to take in life, which I believe
          started to shape my views on equality and politics.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a middle child of three, my sister 3 years older and my brother 2
          years younger. I count myself as extremely fortunate to have been
          raised in a loving, stable family with enough means to be comfortable.
          This made it easier for me to follow my aspirations, knowing I had the
          support (and safety net if I needed) of my family to rely on. My
          mother was (and is) an extremely social person, who easily makes
          friends with everyone she meets and as such we had a large group of
          family friends who all had children around the same age. We would
          often have gatherings and guests at our house and this encouraged me
          to organise large (and sometimes elaborate) group activities and have
          an open door policy regarding my friends. My father was (and is) a
          very intellectual and thoughtful man who enjoyed poetry, psychology
          and ethics and I would often engage with him in good natured debates
          on these topics. This has made me someone who enjoys a good debate as
          well as critically thinking about my own and others thoughts and
          values. I have always prided myself on being a logical person, trying
          to arrive at my opinions by appraising the evidence and having
          humility regarding the things I cannot prove. I try to see arguments
          from others perspectives, use empathy, steel man their arguments and
          try to use their own internal logic to test for flaws in their
          arguments rather than my own. I think of myself as a very fair person,
          who will act honestly, even if it puts me at a disadvantage (as anyone
          who plays board games with me can attest!). Because I like to think
          through options carefully before making a decision, I am not quick to
          anger and am rarely confronting. That is not to say I don’t stand up
          for what I think, there is just usually a non-confrontational way of
          bringing about change in a team based on shared values and
          understanding.
        </p>

          When it came to further education I decided to study medicine. I knew
          I wanted to do something that would help people and would be
          interesting and challenging. I eventually chose to go to university in
          Sheffield. Of the universities that I visited, it was one of the least
          pretentious and most friendly. After a couple of years of being a
          junior doctor, I arranged to work a locum job in New Zealand. I had
          previously been to New Zealand with my family when I was 10 years old
          and I found the country to be beautiful (not to mention warmer!) and I
          always wanted to return. I told the locum agency I didn’t care where
          they sent me or what medical speciality I would do as long as I could
          go to New Zealand! I was given a job working in mental health in
          Palmerston North where I worked for 6 months. I really enjoyed my
          time, both in New Zealand and working in psychiatry. I found the
          speciality fascinating, varied and the long interviews allowed the
          time to get to know patients better and get to the bottom of exactly
          what is worrying them. I enjoyed the less hierarchical team structure
          (say when compared to surgery), with multi-disciplinary team meetings
          involving many different specialities including nurses, psychologists,
          social workers, pharmacists and kaumatua. In medicine, but especially
          in psychiatry we have to deal with ethical dilemmas on a near daily
          basis, weighing up the core principles of beneficence,
          non-maleficence, autonomy and justice. We also have to problem solve
          to arrive at a management plan with the bast chance of working whilst
          safety netting for rarer but more catastrophic outcomes.
        </p>

          I started coding at some point during secondary school, initially with
          GameMaker which introduced the principles of coding and then allowed
          me to explore GML scripts once I was familiar. The thing I have always
          enjoyed about coding is the emergent properties of coding simple lines
          which combine to create a complex result. I paused from coding for the
          first few years of uni, however eventually knew I wanted to return to
          it. I wanted to try something more advanced and Initially I was
          choosing between unity and unreal engine. From what I had researched
          unity was easier to pick up but unreal engine was more powerful.
          Ultimately I decided to try Unity because I found there were more
          resources online to help get me started and to troubleshoot when I ran
          in to problems. I have been doing hobby coding on unity for the past 5
          years or so as well as a spattering of VBA on excel making complicated
          spreadsheets and a little of HTML and Javascript to modify a dungeons
          and dragons campaign I was running on Roll20. I have found I have come
          up with some creative solutions to problems, which I keep working at
          until I solve, however I would say a limitation that I have had is as
          there has not been any deadlines or pressure to finish any of my
          projects, once complex problems are solved, I would tend to then move
          on to the next challenge! In my spare time I tend to do a lot of
          creative projects and whenever there is a deadline I tend to stick to
          it, for example hosting a Eurovision viewing party complete with
          costumes, custom scoring charts and a complicated macro enabled
          spreadsheet to act as a costume database for participants! I am
          therefore confident I can adapt this approach to coding and am looking
          forward to seeing some coding projects all the way through!
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of ethical decision making, I would have to make these
          decisions all the time in psychiatry, especially for example when
          deciding whether a particular patient is so unwell that the nature and
          degree of their mental illness and their risk to themselves or others
          is so significant that it warrants the patient to be detained in
          hospital under the Mental Health Act. This should always be weighed
          against the autonomy of the patient and the least restrictive approach
          which has a reasonable chance of maintaining their safety should be
          selected. Due to confidentiality reasons, I cannot go in to the
          particulars of these situations so instead I shall select a much more
          mundane example!
        </p>
        <p>
          About a year or so ago, I bought a coffee pod machine online and the
          store sent me two machines but only charged me for one. It was one of
          the cheaper machines but still not an insubstantial amount of money. I
          wasn't sure what the legal requirement from me was but I was more
          interested in what the ethical thing to do was. I wondered what most
          people would do in this situation, I thought probably a lot of people
          would return it but possibly a majority of people would keep it or
          sell it. I considered options such as giving it to a friend or to
          charity. I thought about the business that made the mistake, a large
          and not particularly sympathetic company who I imagine would not be so
          hospitable if I made a similar mistake. Ultimately I decided that the
          item was sent to be in error and I knew it was in error and therefore
          it did not belong to me. I had agreed to a transaction and just like I
          would tell someone if they accidently gave me too much money for
          something they bought from me, I felt it was the ethical thing to do
          to return it. The next time I happened to be in town, I dropped it off
          to the store. I suppose if I had planned on keeping it or giving it
          away I would have looked at what my legal responsibility was as whilst
          I believe breaking the law can at times be justified, wanting an extra
          coffee machine is not a good justification!
        </p>
        <p>
          During my previous job there was a situation which caused tension
          within my team. A staff member had taken time off of work with covid,
          however when they returned they were still symptomatic. Two people
          within the team had previously been extremely unwell with
          complications of covid and so were understandably annoyed when this
          person returned to work although they had not said this directly to
          the returning person. This person had made it clear that they were
          following the current guidelines for our work. One of the other staff
          members complained to me about the returning worker. I let them
          offload and decompress to me and I acknowledged the understandable
          reaction they had given their personal history with covid. The team
          mate felt that the returning worker should have known how they and the
          other team members would feel about them returning and should have
          made the decision to stay at home. I acknowledged that this is what
          many would do in this situation, however the returning person was
          quite a rigid rule follower and so it did not surprise me that they
          felt they should follow the rules and come in to work as they might
          have felt like they were breaking a rule by staying at home. I offered
          this explanation and we explored the differences in personalities
          between the returning worker and my teammate and how that can
          sometimes lead to conflict. I suggested that if my teammate wanted to
          address this, a productive way would be to have a team meeting in
          which we could all collaborate and outline our own unofficial
          department rules for what people should do if they are still sick from
          covid. That would help ensure everyone was aware of the same
          expectations and by formalising it as a “rule”, this could help the
          returning worker to feel less guilty about staying at home. Following
          this discussion, the returning worker realised that they had read
          their covid tests wrong and they hadn't been positive anyway!
