        <h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
        <p>
          I am open to see what's out there and to keep an open mind! Currently
          my preferred directions are either full stack developer or game
          developer.
        </p>
        <h1>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h1>
        <p>
          I think I pick things up relatively quickly and am pretty good at
          coming up with creative solutions to logical problems. My limitations
          include sometimes struggling to understand topics in the abstract,
          needing examples to commit the topics to memory, which depending on
          the particulars of the examples can sometimes obscure some aspects of
          the topic.
        </p>
        <h1>
          What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h1>
        <p>Get better at reflecting and journaling!</p>
        <h1>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
        </h1>
        <p>
          I will prioritise working on DevAcademy on the days I am free, aim to
          study nearer the start of the week to give me time to finish anything
          which takes longer than expected. I will work with other learners in a
          productive manner, try to give everyone a chance to speak and
          contribute. I will aim to work collaboratively with others so everyone
          can get ahead. I will be respectful of facilitators and will approach
          them with any concerns or questions. I will try to ask questions early
          on to get the most clarity (after attempting to find any solutions
          myself!) If I have any issues with the course or with others I will
          try to talk to facilitators about these before they become more of a
          problem.
        </p>
        <h1>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h1>
        <p>
          My first port of call if I have any concerns or queries (which I
          cannot find the solutions for myself) will be my facilitator who I can
          message publicly or privately on discord. If there is a need for a
          face to face meeting I can discuss with them who it would be best to
          arrange this with and either sort a facetime or in person meeting.
          There is also the computer setup group if I have specific setup
          questions. I can ask in the main group if for any reason I cannot get
          hold of my facilitator (or privately message another facilitator).
        </p>
        <h1>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h1>
        <p>
          Assistance if I should require it, ideally in a timely manner. Due to
          work commitments, I might need a 12 hours notice or so for any group
          meetings.
        </p>
        <h1>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things
        </h1>
        <p>
          I am still working part time during up until the bootcamp, working 2
          days one week, three days the next. I will hopefully be able to
          confirm exactly which days these will be in the next couple of weeks,
          currently am adjusting week to week. On the days I am working my hours
          are 8:30 - 16:30 during which time I may not be able to answer
          correspondence with devacademy. I have one evening on call shift left,
          this Friday (5/09/25) which will be 8:30 â€“ 22:30.
